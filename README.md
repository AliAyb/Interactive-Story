#### *This interactive story was adapted from the book 'His Dark Materials - Northern Lights'. Please note that some events were altered according to the choices taken by the character in the game where some alternative events were added and some of the original events were removed. We tried to maintain the overall tone and hopefully you'll enjoy playing the game.*

Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and armored bears rule. North, where the Gobblers take the children they steal--including her friend Roger. North, where her fearsome uncle Asriel is trying to build a bridge to a parallel world.
Can one small girl make a difference in such great and terrible endeavors? This is Lyra: a savage, a schemer, and as fierce and true a champion as Roger or Asriel could want.

### Gameplay

* Play as the main character named Lyra.

* In each scene you will have a small script of the story, start by reading it.

* Also have a look at the animation we've included in each scene.

* When you're done with the previous steps, you will have to make a decision to proceed with the game.

* Think thoroughly before making the decision because the wrong decision will lead to a game over.

* On every scene you have a reset button which restarts the game.
