#### This interactive story was adapted from the book 'His Dark Materials - Northern Lights'. Some events were altered according to the choices taken by the character in the game. Some alternative events were added and some of the original events were removed. We tried to maintain the overall tone and hopefully you'll enjoy playing the game.

### The Plot
Lyra is rushing to the cold, far North, where witch clans and armored bears rule, where the Gobblers take the children they steal--including her friend Roger, and where her fearsome uncle Asriel is trying to build a bridge to a parallel world.
Can one small girl make a difference in such great and terrible endeavors? This is Lyra: a savage, a schemer, and as fierce and true a champion as Roger or Asriel could want.

### Gameplay

* Play as the main character Lyra.

* In each scene you will be given a small script explaining and leading up to the choice, start by reading it.

* Some animations were included in each scene.

* When you're done reading the script of each scene, you will  be presented with a decision to proceed with the game.

* Think thoroughly before making the decision as the wrong decision will lead to a game over.

* On every scene you have a reset button to restart the game.
