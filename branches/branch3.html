                <p><strong>Narrator:</strong> When Lyra reached the main hall, she saw a bunch of scholars sitting to
                    the dining table with the Master. She was invited to sit to the table beside them. The scholars were
                    mostly old men with white beards. Some of them she saw before, and some of them she never saw. But
                    among them was in particular a young woman who seemed kind and out of place.

                </p>
                <p><strong>Master:</strong> I’m sorry you didn’t catch up with Lord Asriel, he set off back to the North
                    this morning.

                <p><strong>Lyra:</strong> What? What are you talking about? Why did no one tell me my uncle is
                    travelling today. Why didn’t he speak to me before he went. He promised he was taking me with him?
                </p>
                <p><strong>Master:</strong> Lyra, please don’t raise your voice, we are not responsible for your uncle’s
                    actions.
                    There is someone I’d like to introduce you to. I want you to say hi to Mrs. Coulter, she is working
                    in Paris with the scholars and searching for someone to help her with her research.
                </p>

                <p><strong>The lady scholar (aka Mrs. Coulter):</strong> Roger do you know what dust is?</p>
