                <p><strong>Narrator:</strong> After dinner, Master called Lyra to his room.


                <p><strong>Master:</strong> Mrs. Coulter has talked to me about you. She said she would like to take you
                    to Paris with her as her research assistant. She also told me you’ve accepted her offer. I want to
                    give you this device called the Alethiometer. This device would always tell the truth. But you have
                    to figure out how to use it, and you must never let anyone, especially Mrs. Coulter know about it.
                    Now hurry, child, go get ready. You are taking off in the early morning.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Narrator:</strong> Next day, Lyra was on a hot balloon on her way to Paris.
                    She spent the next few days learning about Mrs. Coulter’s work. However, Mrs. Coulter seems to have
                    changed. She was no longer kind. She was mean and always shouting at Lyra when she did something
                    wrong.
                    Lyra was not getting any information about dust nor about the North. She noticed Mrs. Coulter was
                    always
                    spending her time in a room that was always locked. Lyra figured there was something she needed to
                    see
                    in that room.
                </p>
