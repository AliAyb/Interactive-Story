                <p>Still hiding in the cabinet, Lyra hears muttering about the presence of
                    Lord Asriel. There he was standing in front of everyone.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Lord Asriel:</strong> As you all know, I set out to the North 12 months ago. What you didn’t
                    know is this.

                <p>Lord Asriel slides a photogram into a projector revealing a sharp black
                    and white picture of a man with a small figure behind him and a child, standing in front of a wooden
                    hut showered by moonlight.
                    In a second slide,the same image, this time filtered. The man and the figure were glowing with
                    light, particles danced around them. The child, however, had no glow around him.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Lord Asriel:</strong> Gentlemen, this is not light. This is dust.</p>

                <p><strong>Lyra:</strong> Roger do you know what dust is?</p>
                <p><strong>Roger:</strong> Of Course, I spend all day cleaning it.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Lyra:</strong> No, not that kind of dust. I heard the scholars talking with my uncle Asriel
                    about a subatomic
                    particle called dust that surrounds only grown ups.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Roger:</strong> No, I don’t know what that is. But do you know what Gobblers are?
                </p>
                <p><strong>Lyra:</strong>Gobblers?</p>
                <p><strong>Roger:</strong>Yes they kidnap children. I heard that Billy Costa was also kidnapped. The
                    gyptian tribe is
                    searching all over the place for him. I’ve heard that the Gobblers take the children North.</p>

                <p>Lyra woke up the next day, and went searching for Roger to play hide and
                    seek as they had
                    agreed the day before. She couldn’t find him. Not in the kitchen where he used to work, not in the
                    basement where they used to play, not on the roof where he hid when sad, not anywhere.
                    While searching, she sees the gyptians packing their luggage and getting on a ship near the college.
