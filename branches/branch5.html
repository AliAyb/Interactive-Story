                <p><strong>Mrs. Coulter:</strong> I also make trips from time to time to the North to do field research.
                    I am currently looking for someone to help me as it’s too much work for one person. If you are
                    interested I could convince the Master to allow you to come with me. I would teach you about my work
                    and I could certainly use the extra brain and hands.

                <p>Lyra was so excited to know that Mrs. Coulter is studying the dust and
                    travels along with her. She thought this was a good chance to learn more about what her uncle was
                    talking about and where the Gobblers might have taken Billy and maybe Roger.
                </p>
